A:
1. My passion is honestly something relating to Computer Software. I've played with computers
for a long time, so I guess my job is always related to it.

2.I think because if my background in IT major, I'm always interested in programming matters. 
At the same time, I see sometimes developer needs extra help on ensuring the quality of their code.
This is why I like being a QA Engineer, to give devs extra hands

3.If I look on the work side, I strive to make sure each feature that the dev created got covered in a
comprehensive test cases. Each features should also be well documented, and alongside it, evidence of
testing. On the other hand, if we look on career path, I want to improve both my skill as a QA Engineer
and my skill at working with others, in hope I could be an experienced senior and have easier time
teaching other the importance of testing

4.To reach my goal, I would make sure to gave each of my task a clear test cases and documentation
that could be understood by all of my teammates, whether its other QA, developer, or product and managers.
At the same time, I would like to develop my skills with the help of other teammates too.

5. I expect to learn more skills relating to QA Testing and met kind and helpful teammates and supervisors.
